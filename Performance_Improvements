There are some bottlenecks in the development environment that needs some addressing.

As it is only one system we are bounded by number of processors(as it is cpu bound task) to do the processing.

If we have K8s cluster with us, we can do some Map-Reduce type calculations to do calculations more in parallel.

The Approach:-
    1. Create an AWS EKS cluster with expected nodes and podes.
    2. Upload the dataset on S3
    3. Have an AWS lambda function that
        1. Gets triggered when there is a new dataset is uploaded
        2. Divides the dataset based on the cluster configuration mentioned in step 1
        3. Put those distribution messages on SQS queue
    4. Pods fetches the messages from SQS queue and download the folders from S3 or have a volume mount on S3
    5. Start finding those embedded vectors in pods.
    6. Somehow(another lambda, SNS notification) trigger a reducer that computes the average once all pods are done.

But such approach comes with it's own challenges as described below.
    1. Managing workloads across the fleet of compute nodes.
    2. As it is CPU bound task we need to make sure 1 pod/1 Node otherwise pods fighting for CPU will make matter worse.
    3. The cost of managing nodes should not be ignored as well.
